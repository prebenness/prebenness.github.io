Greetings traveler. My name is Preben M. Ness, and this is my website. Here I have collected all of my relevant online presence: academic publications, opinion pieces, as well as some more personal projects.

My research is on how to build Neural Networks using the toolkit of Causal Inference, instead of traditional statistics. Although well established in medical and economic research, causality has only recently gained traction as a framework in Deep Learning.
